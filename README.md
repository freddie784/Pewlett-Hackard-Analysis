# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of analysis
the purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per titles so they can prepare for future hiring. Also Pewlett wanted to start a mentorship program so a table of employees that were eligible for that was created as well.

## Results
below are four key results that were found during my analysis

--As one would predict the majority of the retirees consist of the senior positions but Senior Engineers is the position with the most retirees

--The total number of potential retirees in nonsenior positions is 26,465.


-- We have 1549 employees that can potentially join our mentorship program

--Below are amounts of eligible employees for the mentorship program by title.

## Summary
After analyzing all potential retirees and summing with ***SELECT SUM(count) FROM retiring_titles;*** We found the total was 90,398 employees are due to retire from Pewlett-Hackard. Also below is a table from the file created from retiring_titles show the number of employees that will be leaving per title.

When comparing the tables we find that the amount of  potential retirees and eligible mentors ratio is severely skewed. on example is it almost a 1/100 ratio of mentor per retiree for Senior engineers. There are not enough mentors for the Senior positions so the qualifications for eligibility need to be configured or taking a different approach to fulfilling the work that needs to be done.

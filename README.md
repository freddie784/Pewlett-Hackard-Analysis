# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of analysis
the purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per titles so they can prepare for future hiring. Also Pewlett wanted to start a mentorship program so a table of employees that were eligible for that was created as well.

## Results
below are four key results that were found during my analysis

--As one would predict the majority of the retirees consist of the senior positions but Senior Engineers is the position with the most retirees

--The total number of potential retirees in nonsenior positions is 26,465.


-- We have 1549 employees that can potentially join our mentorship program

--Below are amounts of eligible employees for the mentorship program by title.

## Summary
After analyzing all potential retirees and summing with ***SELECT SUM(count) FROM retiring_titles;*** We found the total was 90,398 employees are due to retire from Pewlett-Hackard. Also below is a table from the file created from retiring_titles show the number of employees that will be leaving per title.

Below is the amount of eligible employees for the mentorship program by title.
***Add Picture***
When comparing the tables we find that the amount of  potential retirees and eligible mentors ratio is severely skewed. on example is it almost a 1/100 ratio of mentor per retiree for Senior engineers. There are not enough mentors for the Senior positions so the qualifications for eligibility need to be configured or taking a different approach to fulfilling the work that needs to be done.
